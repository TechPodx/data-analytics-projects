## 1) About the Project

### üëâ Why This project

- Showcases **BI Analyst** skills in **Power BI, Power Query, and DAX**, focused on renewable energy traceability.
- Translates half-hourly grid data into **business-ready KPIs**: CFE% (24/7), residual load, and emissions (location vs market).
- Presents a **client-style dashboard** suitable for corporate energy and sustainability reporting.

### üëâ Business Problem

Large corporate energy buyers are under pressure to:

- Prove that their electricity consumption is genuinely matched by renewables, 24/7, not just on a yearly average.
- Report carbon emissions under Scope 2 (location-based vs market-based) with confidence for regulators, investors, and sustainability ratings.
- Understand when and why shortfalls occur (residual demand not covered by renewables) so they can plan PPAs, storage, or demand shifting.

Traditional reporting only shows an annual renewable %, which hides the real hourly gaps and prevents businesses from making operational or procurement decisions.

### üëâ What This Project Solves

This BI dashboard demonstrates how SmartestEnergy (or a similar supplier) could provide business clients with:

- 24/7 Traceability: interval-level matching between customer demand and renewable generation.
- Clear KPIs (CFE%, Residual MWh, Avoided Emissions): making carbon reporting more transparent and audit-ready.
- Fuel Mix Transparency: showing how different sources (wind, solar, gas, imports, etc.) drive performance and emissions.
- Emissions Accounting: direct comparison of location-based vs market-based emissions, aligned with Scope 2 guidance.

### üëâ Business Impact

- Trust & Differentiation: Builds confidence with corporate clients that SmartestEnergy is delivering true 24/7 renewable coverage, not just averages.
- Decision Support: Helps sustainability and procurement teams target the worst hours/days with new contracts (PPAs), storage, or load-shifting strategies.
- Regulatory Compliance: Simplifies Scope 2 carbon reporting by providing both location-based and market-based emissions transparently.
- Competitive Edge: Positions the company as a partner for net-zero journeys, offering data-driven insights that most suppliers cannot.
- Financial Impact: Better renewable matching reduces exposure to carbon costs, enhances reputation, and helps retain/attract clients seeking renewable guarantees.

## 2) Dataset

- **File from Kaggle:** [Data File](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielparke/uk-energy-data-2020-23?resource=download&select=UK_Fuel_Mix.csv)
- **Granularity:** 30-minute intervals (48 per day)  
- **Key columns used:**  
  `DATETIME`, `NET_DEMAND`, `GENERATION`, `RENEWABLE`, `FOSSIL`,  
  `GAS`, `COAL`, `NUCLEAR`, `UK_WIND`, `HYDRO`, `SOLAR`, `BIOMASS`, `IMPORTS`, `OTHER`, `STORAGE`,  
  `CARBON_INTENSITY` (gCO‚ÇÇ/kWh)

> **Unit convention:** Each row is MW for a 30-minute period ‚Üí **MWh = MW √ó 0.5**.

---

## 3) Tools & Skills

- **Power BI Desktop** (Modeling & Visuals)
- **Power Query (M)** for import, type assignment, and feature engineering
- **DAX** measures for energy math, 24/7 matching, and emissions
- **Design**: Consistent theme, accessible color choices, exportable layout

---

## 4) Data Model

**Facts**
- `Fact_Interval` (wide): one row per half-hour with load/generation totals, renewable/fossil, carbon intensity, and helper columns `Date`, `Time`, `HalfHourSlot`.
- `Fact_GenLong` (long): unpivoted generation by `FuelType` with `MW`, plus `Date`, `HalfHourSlot`.

**Dimensions**
- `Dim_Date` (marked as Date table): `Date`, `Year`, `MonthNo`, `Month`, `YearMonth`, `Quarter`, `Week`, `Day`, `DayOfWeekNo`, `DayName`, `IsWeekend`, `Season`.
- `Dim_Time`: `SettlementPeriod` (1‚Äì48), `TimeText` (00:00‚Ä¶23:30).
- `Dim_Source`: `FuelType` ‚Üí `IsRenewable` (TRUE/FALSE), `CarbonGroup` (ZeroCarbon/LowCarbon/Fossil/Other).

**Relationships**
- `Dim_Date[Date]` ‚Üí `Fact_Interval[Date]` (1:*)
- `Dim_Date[Date]` ‚Üí `Fact_GenLong[Date]` (1:*)
- `Dim_Time[SettlementPeriod]` ‚Üí `Fact_Interval[HalfHourSlot]` (1:*)
- `Dim_Time[SettlementPeriod]` ‚Üí `Fact_GenLong[HalfHourSlot]` (1:*)
- `Dim_Source[FuelType]` ‚Üí `Fact_GenLong[FuelType]` (1:*)

> Cross-filter direction: **Single** (Dim ‚Üí Fact).  
> Hide `Date/Time/HalfHourSlot` inside facts to force slicing from dimensions.

## 7) How to Use

1. Select **Year-Month** to focus the period.  
2. Use **Quater** to focus the specific quater.  
3. Read KPIs on the Overview; inspect **Top 10 residual days**.  
4. Drill into **Heatmap** to spot worst **half-hours**.  
5. Use **Generation Mix** to understand fuel drivers and carbon trends.

---

## 8) Assumptions & Methodology

- **Granularity:** 30-minute settlement periods; all KPIs aggregate from interval level.  
- **CFE% (24/7):** interval-by-interval matching (`min(load, renewable)`), not just annual renewable share.  
- **Emissions accounting:**  
  - *Location-based* = total load √ó grid average carbon intensity.  
  - *Market-based* = **residual** load (unmatched by renewables) √ó grid average carbon intensity.  
- **Grouping:** `Dim_Source` assigns fuels to **CarbonGroup** and **IsRenewable** for visual rollups.

---

## 9) Data Quality & Validation

- **Completeness:** enforced 48 intervals/day via `HalfHourSlot` (1‚Äì48).  
- **Type safety:** `DATETIME` as Date/Time; all metrics **Decimal Number** in Power Query.  
- **Reconciliation:** Long-table fuels sum close to `GENERATION` (small differences may arise from excluded categories).

---

## 10) Refresh & Automation (suggested)

- Manual: **Refresh** in Power BI Desktop.  
- Future: Schedule refresh in **Power BI Service** and email a PDF of the **Energy Label** page via **Power Automate**.

---

## 11) Limitations

- Uses GB system-level data; no customer smart-meter load in this demo.  
- Market-based logic assumes zero emissions for matched renewable energy (no certificate/REGO tracking here).  
- Imports are treated as a single category without origin-specific intensities.

---

## 12) Roadmap (next pages to add)

- **Scenario Studio (What-If):**  
  - Parameter **ContractCoverage %** (0‚Äì120).  
  - Measures: `Contract_CFE %`, `Contract_MarketEmissions_tCO2`, `Emissions_Delta_tCO2`, `CFE_Uplift_pp`.  
  - Visuals: KPI row, **Baseline vs Contract** bars or **Waterfall**, line of **CFE% vs Scenario** by month.

- **Energy Label (printable 1-pager):**  
  - Cards: **CFE% (24/7)**, **Load (MWh)**, **Renewable (MWh)**, **Market tCO‚ÇÇ**, **Avoided tCO‚ÇÇ** (if scenario shown).  
  - Donut/bar: **Fuel share**.  
  - Small monthly table & **methodology** text.  
  - Export: **File ‚Üí Export ‚Üí PDF**.
