SELECT ROUND(SUM(total_price),2) AS Total_Revenue 
FROM pizza_sales_data;

-- Average Order Value
SELECT ROUND(SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id), 2) AS Average_Order_Value 
FROM pizza_sales_data;

-- Total Pizzas Sold
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM pizza_sales_data;

SELECT SUM(quantity) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Average_Pizza_Per_Order
FROM pizza_sales_data;
```
### **2. Charts Queries**
```SQL
-- Daily Trend for Total Orders
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS Order_Day,
       COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales_data
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);

-- Monthly Trend for Total Orders
SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) AS Order_Month,
       COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales_data
GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, order_date)
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC;

-- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category
SELECT pizza_category,
       ROUND(SUM(total_price) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales_data), 2) AS Pct_Sales
FROM pizza_sales_data
GROUP BY pizza_category;

-- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size
SELECT pizza_size,
       ROUND(SUM(total_price) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales_data), 2) AS Pct_Sales
FROM pizza_sales_data
GROUP BY pizza_size;

-- Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM pizza_sales_data
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;
```
